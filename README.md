if you already have python3 installed  
in cmd type: pip install pyqt5  
this also requires google chrome  
  
to exlude your name from the search, open username.py with notepad and type your username  
now you should be able to open the gui by running league.py  
Once gui is open you should be able to copy the text of who joined chat  
and paste it in the text box ex:  
  
StanzaOnDubz joined the lobby  
Shinji lkari joined the lobby  
Rebel Preacher joined the lobby  
NSFW Plays joined the lobby  
l Padfoot l joined the lobby  
    
Now just hit go, and if you are using chrome it will open in that
